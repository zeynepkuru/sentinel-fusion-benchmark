## Sentinel Fusion Benchmark

This project explores pixel-level image fusion between Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery over a heterogeneous study area in Çanakkale, Türkiye. It benchmarks three classical image fusion algorithms—Intensity-Hue-Saturation (IHS), Brovey Transform, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)—to assess their spatial and spectral fidelity. Evaluation is based on structural similarity (SSIM), root mean square error (RMSE), and Pearson correlation with respect to both SAR and optical references.

The code includes preprocessing steps such as geometric alignment, normalization, and histogram matching, along with visualization and metric computation tools. This project is part of the Advanced Remote Sensing 2024–2025 term course.
